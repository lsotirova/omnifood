### Website Design Elements

#### Typography System

The website employs a well-defined typography system to ensure consistent and visually appealing text across its pages. It specifies font sizes in pixels, ranging from 10px to 98px, along with various font weights, line heights, and letter spacing for enhancing the readability and aesthetic quality of the content.

#### Colors

A carefully chosen color palette is used to create a visually appealing design. The primary color, #e67e22, is complemented by tints and shades of the same color to provide depth and variation in the site's appearance. The website also includes accent colors and shades of gray for a harmonious and balanced color scheme.

#### Shadows

To create subtle depth and visual interest, the website utilizes a shadow effect with dimensions (0, 2.4rem, 4.8rem) and a semi-transparent black color. This shadow is applied to certain elements to provide a sense of elevation.

#### Border Radius

Consistent border radius values are defined to give elements rounded corners. The default border radius is set at 9px, while a medium option with 11px is available for specific elements, enhancing the overall design.

#### White Space

A systematic spacing system is established for maintaining consistent spacing between various elements throughout the website. This system uses specific pixel values (e.g., 2px, 4px, 8px, etc.) to ensure uniformity in layout and content positioning.

#### Website Structure

##### HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the website follows best practices for creating a structured and organized layout. It includes container elements for different sections of the site, and it incorporates responsive design principles using CSS classes for different screen sizes.

##### CSS Styles

The CSS file provides a comprehensive set of styles for the website. It covers general reusable components such as containers, grids, headings, buttons, links, and lists. The styles for buttons include full and outline options with varying colors and hover effects for user interaction.

##### JavaScript Functionality

The website includes JavaScript code to enhance user interactivity, create dynamic content, and handle client-side functionality:

- **Set Current Year:** JavaScript code sets the current year in the website footer.
- **Mobile Navigation:** It makes the mobile navigation menu work, allowing users to open and close the navigation menu by clicking a button.
- **Smooth Scrolling Animation:** When users click on internal links, this JavaScript code provides a smooth scrolling animation to navigate to the respective sections of the page.
- **Sticky Navigation:** The navigation bar becomes sticky when scrolling down the page, improving user navigation.
- **Fixing Flexbox Gap:** To ensure compatibility with various browsers, JavaScript checks for support for the flexbox gap property and applies a CSS class to address the issue if necessary.

The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript creates an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website with dynamic functionality, providing an engaging user experience.
